Buyers often struggle to understand the motives underlying salesperson actions (Alavi et al. 2018). With a plethora of activities, lines of persuasion, and recurrent interactions occurring over the span of a typical buyer-seller relationship, relational partners are left to their own  devices  to  make  sense of these complex exchanges. Given that buyers  may hold pre-disposed suspicions of salesperson intentions  (Friend, Johnson, and Sohi 2018; Wood et al. 2008), transac- tion cost economics (TCE) cautions them to guard against opportunism�characterized by lying, shirking, or miscreant behavior (Williamson 1985). TCE encourages  buyers  to  focus on the development of governance structures designed to limit their exposure to opportunism a priori (Rindfleisch and Heide 1997). However, equivocal salesperson actions (as opposed to blatant opportunism; Stump and Heide 1996) also exist, which are difficult for buyers to assess as either self- interest seeking with guile or as innocent mistakes. Guileful action refers to when a trading partner surreptitiously masks miscreant intent as benign (Das and Teng 1998). For example, salespeople may inflate lead times to entice buyers into pre- mature purchases. Governance  structures  are  designed  to guide interfirm performance, but the influence of thesestructures on interpretations of specific  salesperson  acts remains a topic in need of investigation (Wathne et al. 2018).The unobservable nature of guile creates the aforemen- tioned ex post inference problem in buyer-seller relationships (Anderson and Jap 2005; Seggie, Griffith, and Jap  2013).  This problem is integral to the continuity of buyer-seller relationships, as perceptions of opportunism are  likely  to have adverse effects on relationship quality and may result     in relationship dissolution (Crosno and Dahlstrom 2008; Scheer 2012). Even at the individual-level, perceptions of salesperson opportunism may trigger a buyer�s response to bring balance back to the relationship and manage future exchanges (Bradach and Eccles 1989; Brown, Krishen, and Dev 2014). The goal of this research is to gain a better understanding of how industrial buyers evaluate question-  able behavior undertaken by their salesperson. Two objec- tives underlie this goal.  First is the objective to examine how characteristics of the interfirm relationship influence buyer attributions. As it  is likely that factors associated with the buyer-seller relationship play a role in determining the buyer�s attribution of guile� either internalizing the action to the salesperson or
externalizing the action to the environment�we examine  how relational factors influence the buyer�s perceptions of questionable salesperson behaviors. We treat transaction spe- cific investments (TSIs), asymmetric interdependence, con- tractual arrangements, and relationship solidarity as governance factors designed to influence interfirm perform- ance (Bradach and Eccles 1989; Tracey, Heide, and Bell 2014). We employ logic from attribution theory (Gilbert and Malone 1995) to implicate these relational factors as deter- minants of buyer evaluations of equivocal salesperson behav- ior; while also identifying conditions leading to assertions of deception and attributions of salesperson opportunism. Such findings are important for sales organizations to gain a bet-   ter understanding of how their salespeople�s actions are per- ceived in the eyes of their buyers, while also enabling salespeople to appreciate buyer responses to  their  actions  (see Paesbrugghe et al. 2018).  The second objective of this research is to examine influ- ences of perceived salesperson  opportunism  on  the  quality of the interfirm working relationship. We therefore investi- gate whether perceived salesperson opportunism affects the quality of the interfirm relationship�i.e., the buyer�s willing- ness to invest in the relationship, expectations of  relation- ship continuity,  and  retributive  opportunism.  Consistent with extant research acknowledging that opportunism begets opportunism (Gundlach, Achrol, and Mentzer 1995), we introduce retributive opportunism as a buyer�s response to perceived guileful self-interest seeking by the salesperson. Such a context is relevant given the ongoing and long-term nature of B2B exchanges (Friend and Johnson 2017), as the buyer must decide how to respond appropriately while the relational exchange plays out. Despite the theoretical and practical relevance of such retributive opportunistic acts, research is yet to address this issue empirically. Our research thus introduces a novel concept to the sales literature and develops insights regarding the reciprocal, retaliatory  nature of opportunism.  Insights from this research are based on two studies con- ducted with business-to-business (B2B) buyers. The first  study collected data in the medical field and the follow-up study assessed data provided by buyers representing multiple industries. Findings contribute to emergent lines of sales research aimed at understanding when buyers infer ulterior salesperson motives (e.g., Alavi et al. 2018) and how deriv- ing insights from the buyer�s side of the dyad can aid in developing effective sales strategy (e.g., Paesbrugghe et al. 2018). More specifically, this study contributes to an interre- lated series of knowledge gaps within periphery domains. Extant research on topics such as (a) salesperson opportun- ism and deception, (b) salesperson influence tactics, and (c) buyer suspicion and salesperson ulterior motives have cre- ated a foundation for which this study  is  positioned  to extend the current body of knowledge. Such research has shown the drivers and consequences of salesperson miscre- ant actions (i.e., opportunism, deception) and persuasion attempts (i.e., influence tactics). In such cases, the ulterior motives of salespeople have also been assessed as an under- lying mechanism driving adverse relational outcomes and
buyer responses. As such, extant research has identified intrafirm controls and interfirm governance mechanisms to mitigate the occurrence of opportunism. This study is able      to extend such research by uniquely (a) focusing on equivo- cal salesperson actions, (b) adopting a multi-faceted perspec- tive regarding relational conditions which simultaneously shape buyer perceptions, (c) collecting data from the buyer�s side of the dyad in order to identify responses that occur within the context of an ongoing relationship, and (d) intro- ducing the notion that buyer�s may engage in retributive opportunism (see Table 1).  The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows: First, we review relevant attribution  literature  predicting  how situational factors affect evaluations of trading partner behavior. We then draw on interfirm theory to develop antecedents and consequences of questionable salesperson behavior. The manuscript then outlines the  research  meth- ods and results. As we conclude with a discussion of impli-  cations, the findings are integrated into extant research in  order to provide a foundation for theoretical and practical implications.Literature review and conceptual modelDespite the emphasis that sales organizations place on build- ing and maintaining long-term buyer-seller relationships (Gonzalez, Hoffman, and Ingram 2005; Morgan and Hunt 1994), it is often difficult for buyers to determine beforehand which salespeople will engage in opportunism (Ghoshal and Moran 1996). In his development of TCE, Williamson (1975) defines opportunism as self-interest seeking with guile. TCE suggests that as the potential for opportunism increases, organizations must design control structures to ensure pro- ductive use of their assets (Rindfleisch and Heide 1997; Williamson 1985). At the same time, however, research also suggests relational partners often cannot easily determine after the fact if a partner has engaged in opportunistic  behaviors  due to the unobservable nature of guile (John 1984). Consequently, buyers often have to make inferences regarding the intentions and motivations of salesperson behaviors, and they tend to make such interpretations in light of various conditions surrounding the relationship.  The  buyer�s  process of interpreting salesperson behaviors then determines  the extent to which the buyer-seller relationship is adversely affected in the long-term, with theory suggesting that one method for buyers to  form  such  interpretations  is  through the attribution process.  Attribution theory offers insight concerning inference problems that arise when a relational partner observes ques- tionable behavior. Attribution theory posits that individuals make causal inferences regarding their  own  behavior  and  the behavior of others (Kelley 1972). An individual�s exam- ination of internal and external forces leads to these infer- ences (Gilbert and Malone 1995). Internal forces reside  within the individual and include emotions, traits, and enduring attitudes; whereas external forces refer to the situational constraints  in  the  environment  (Malle  2006).  For example, when a salesperson overcharges a buyer for a shipment, the buyer may either embrace an internal
interpretation (i.e., the salesperson is unprincipled) or exter- nal interpretation (i.e., the supplier firm�s new logistics sys- tem must have erred).  Extant research has found that actor-observer asymmetry  in the attribution process (e.g., Nisbett et al.  1973;  Ross  1977; Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz  1977),  where  actors tend to explain their behavior in terms of situational causes  and observers tend to explain the actor�s behavior with  internal causes. Numerous studies have shown that observ-   ers tend to underestimate the power of  a  situation  (e.g.,  Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz 1977) and, as a result, mis- takenly attribute behavior to the actor�s disposition. Correspondence bias refers to the �tendency to draw infer-  ences about a person�s unique and  enduring  dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the  situ- ation in which they occur� (Gilbert and Malone 1995, 21).  According to Gilbert and Malone (1995), errors in the attribution process can explain the tendency of observers to succumb to this bias and consists of a sequence of events in doing so. First, the observer must recognize the situation in which the actor is functioning. Second, the observer gener- ates expectations about how actors typically behave in such situations. Third, the observer perceives and categorizes the actor�s behavior. Finally, the observer  determines  whether the behavior violates the expectations that the situation has engendered. The focus of the current study is on the third step�the perception and categorization of the actor�s behav- ior. However, errors in any one of these events may lead to correspondence bias, and consequently, perceptions of opportunism in light of questionable or equivocal behaviors. One would expect  correspondence  bias  to  disappear when there is transparency between buyers and salespeople, as they would be aware of situational constraints impacting
each other�s behaviors. The awareness would enable them to develop realistic expectations for behavior and to appropri- ately discount the behavior (Gilbert 1995).  However,  research suggests that awareness of situational constraints  may also lead to correspondence bias (Gilbert and Malone 1995; Trope 1986). Observers generate expectations about how people typically act in certain situations, and then they compare the actor�s behavior with these expectations. Observers, however, compare their expectations with their perceptions of the actor�s behavior rather than the actor�s  actual behavior (Gilbert and Malone 1995). An observer�s awareness of situational factors may result in perceptual assimilation of behaviors (i.e., inflated categorization effect; see Trope, Cohen, and Maoz 1988), particularly equivocal behaviors that cannot be easily categorized. In a buyer-seller relationship, a buyer�s expectation of salesperson self-interest seeking with guile �may induce perceptual assimilation  of  that behavior� (Gilbert and Malone 1995, 28).  In this current study, we examine relational factors sur- rounding buyer-seller relationships that influence the attri- bution process. In their review of interfirm interactions, Bradach and Eccles (1989) suggest that economic, authorita- tive, and trust-based governance mechanisms influence the productivity of interfirm  relationships  (Rindfleisch  and Heide 1997); yet research also indicates little theorizing has examined how governance variables combine to affect firm outcomes (Wathne et al. 2018). We characterize TSIs, asym- metric interdependence, and contractual arrangements as firm-level characteristics that influence the attributions of guile. We implicate these factors as direct determinants of attributions, but we also suggest that the relationship soli- darity operating between the salesperson and the buyer miti- gates these effects.

Research on salesperson opportunism shows the consequences that deception can have on buyer- seller exchanges. Much of the research in the domain has focused on organizational controls and governance mechanisms which can decrease salesperson opportunism. However, while relationship conditions have been investigated in piecemeal to form an understanding of their influence on attributing salesperson opportunism, multiple relational conditions should be looked at simultaneously to develop a more complete picture. Further, while relationship consequences have been identified, specific buyer responses have received scant attention.Research on influence tactics captures the adaptive nature of sales persuasion. When utilized properly, influence tactics can generate desirable outcomes associated with sales performance and buyer value perceptions. When used improperly, adverse buyer responses may ensue. However, while salesperson influence tactics are purposively utilized by salespeople, insights regarding equivocal salesperson actions have received little attention. It remains unknown how buyers will respond to such unconscious tactics.Research on buyer suspicion captures factors impacting perceived salesperson ulterior motives. Such research is predominately focused on how the buyer interprets salesperson transgressions, as well as resultant buyer purchase intentions and salesperson recovery efforts. What is less salient is how buyers respond within the contexts of ongoing relationships or the notion of punitive responses (i.e., retributive opportunism).

in which we examine whether governance structures influ- ence the buyer�s attribution of salesperson guile in a discrete event. We subsequently examine whether the attribution regarding this event influences perceptions of salesperson opportunism. While prior research has looked at  similar  issues to develop governance systems designed to influence decision-making and ensure acceptable performance (e.g., Kumar, Heide, and Wathne 2011), the effect of these sys- tems on evaluations of exchange behavior has received lim- ited attention (see Table 1). We address this gap by using relationship factors to describe the inductive process of the buyer�s perception of salesperson guileful behavior,  while  also studying the buyer�s response and reciprocation to these perceptions via relationship outcomes.Hypotheses developmentAntecedents of attributions of salesperson guileAlthough some behaviors are easily perceived and catego- rized by the observer, other behaviors are equivocal that
�may be profoundly affected by the knowledge of the con-  text in which they occurred� (Gilbert and Malone 1995, 28). The focus of this study is the latter�i.e., equivocal behavior that, depending on the context, could be perceived as mis- creant, self-interest seeking behavior or as a benign salesper- son interaction. We treat  attribution  of  guile  as  the degree to which a specific, deceptive behavior is attributable to the action of the salesperson.  The control structures that serve as the independent vari- ables in this study derive from the analysis of plural forms     of governance conducted by Bradach and  Eccles  (1989).  This approach frames price, authority, and trust-based mechanisms as controls that regulate transactions. TSIs rep- resent sunk costs endemic to the relationship (Williamson 1985). The cost of these investments is the price paid should the relationship dissolve. Asymmetric interdependence is an authoritative mechanism associated with higher trading part- ner compliance (Gu and Wang 2011). Solidarity provides an indicator of the degree to which trust regulates a relation-  ship. As a form of trust, it serves a lubricant of the social system that enables transacting parties to rely on their
trading partner (Arrow 1974). Plural forms logic also recog- nize that control structures can evince aspects multiple gov- ernance structures (Rindfleisch and Heide 1997). Contracts that outline buyer and seller responsibilities serve as authori- tative mechanisms. By specifying product costs, they also serve as price-based mechanisms. Consider next such influ- ences of TSIs, asymmetric interdependence, contractual arrangements, and relationship solidarity on the  likelihood that buyers attribute an act to  the  intentions  of  a salesperson.Transaction specific investmentsTSIs are specialized assets that have considerably less value outside their intended use (Williamson 1985). TSIs create a safeguarding problem because owners of these assets cannot easily re-deploy them to other relationships (Rindfleisch and Heide 1997). Thus, investments that are specific to a given buyer-seller relationship create vulnerabilities  and  lock  in  the investing party, leaving the non-investing party able to expropriate the value of the specialized assets (Rokkan,  Heide, and Wathne 2003).  When buyers incur greater TSIs, salespeople could plaus- ibly leverage this investment due to the high switching costs facing the buyer (Rindfleisch and Heide 1997; Tremblay, Co^t'e,  and  Balkin  2003).  The  buyer  thus  feels  susceptible  to potential acts of malfeasance (Anderson  and  Weitz  1992), and such sentiment may result in perceptions that equivocal salesperson actions are motivated by individual constraints on behavior (e.g., guile). As argued by Hunter, Gassenheimer, and Siguaw (2011, 1183), when �vulnerable parties fear being victimized,  suspicions not only exists, but tend to spiral out   of control.� Buyers, therefore, are more likely to attribute equivocal behaviors as within the control of the salesperson when specific investments create a favorable context for self- interested behavior (Crosno and Dahlstrom 2016). This attri- bution is thus expected to result in perceptions of salesperson guile in light of equivocal behaviors due to perceptual assimi- lation (Trope 1986). By contrast, when the buyer�s TSIs are low  and  they  have  lower  costs  to  switching   suppliers,   the buyer is less vulnerable and therefore less suspicious. Hence the buyer is less likely to assume salesperson intention- ality to plausibly guileful behaviors. Therefore, we propose the following:H1: Buyer transaction specific investments are related positively to the attribution of salesperson guile.Asymmetric interdependenceInterdependence exists when �two or more  organizations must take each other into account if they are to accomplish their goals� (Cadotte and Stern 1979, 133). Levels of inter-  dependence can range from symmetric to asymmetric, with the latter reflecting a relationship in which one channel member is more dependent than the other member (Scheer, Miao, and Palmatier 2015). While symmetric dependence is illustrative of a relationship in which both firms have much   to lose if dysfunctional conflict compromises its effectiveness (Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp 1995), the same is not true
for asymmetric dependence. When a buyer is asymmetrically dependent, relatively less motivation exists for the salesper- son to refrain from guileful, self-interested acts  given  that they will not occur substantive losses if the relationship fal- ters (Gulati and Sytch 2007). Being asymmetrically depend- ent may create buyer apprehension, resulting in equivocal salesperson behaviors being interpreted as miscreant.  Stated otherwise, the less  dependent  relational  member has less motivation to avoid conflict. Indeed, extant research has found that interdependence asymmetry results in more dysfunction, increased levels of conflict, less stability, lower trust, and decreased  commitment  (Anderson  and  Weitz 1992; Gundlach and Cadotte 1994; Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp 1995), than interdependence symmetry. These studies collectively suggest that  interdependence asymmetry is expected to give rise to exploitation  (Gundlach  and  Cadotte 1994), and as mentioned, vulnerability to exploit- ation increases expectations of such behavior (Hunter, Gassenheimer, and Siguaw (2011). Therefore, a  buyer  in such a context may be more likely to categorize plausibly deceitful salesperson behaviors as intentional. By contrast, when both parties are equally at risk if the relational bond is jeopardized, the buyer would expect the  salesperson  to refrain from behaviors that would jeopardize the relation-  ship. Due to perceptual assimilation (Trope 1986), the buyer would thus be less likely to attribute guile internally to the salesperson. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:H2: Buyer asymmetric interdependence is related positively to the attribution of salesperson guile.Contractual arrangementsContractual arrangements are  conceptualized  as  the  extent  to which a contract between firms regulates operations. Iron-clad contracts play a significant role in buyer-seller relationships, as TCE emphasizes the need for control struc- tures to maintain productivity and  secure  investments  (Ghosh and John 1999). Contracts also provide  a written set of obligations regulating interfirm interaction (Bradach and Eccles 1989), with more specific contracts increasing the extent to which the buyer and salesperson are locked-in to following certain protocol (Mooi and Ghosh 2010). Thus,  with sanctions in place that specify consequences for non- compliance, each party faces steep costs for engaging in con- tractual breaches (Johnson and Sohi 2016). Such reciprocal consequences are in part influenced by the extent to which  one party views the other as consciously breaking the terms   of the contract (Li et al. 2013).  In a buyer-seller relationship, the presence of contractual arrangements may influence the lens by which the buyer  views certain salesperson behaviors. When a contractual agreement is in place, salespeople are well aware that if a contractual breach occurs and is perceived to be within their control, then compensatory actions may take place (Johnson and Sohi 2016). Thus, the salesperson is less likely to engage in actions that breach the contract. Buyers� expectations of opportunism, in turn, are lower. Due to perceptual assimila- tion (Trope 1986), the buyer is more likely to attribute equivocal acts to external forces rather than salesperson
intent. Inversely, when weak  contractual  arrangements  are  in place and the salesperson faces little risk in pushing the bounds of what may be considered guileful, the buyer has    less reason to believe that the salesperson would try to miti- gate such behaviors from occurring. As such, the buyer is more likely to interpret equivocal behaviors as guileful. Specifically, we expect the following:H3: Contractual arrangements are related negatively to the attribution of salesperson guile.Relationship solidarityRelational norms reflect expectations about behavior that are partially shared by a group of decision makers (Heide and John 1992). Solidarity is one such relational norm that shifts an individual�s focus from his  or her own  party�s outcomes  to the shared benefits at the relationship level  (Macneil  1981). In other words, both parties strive for  joint  value rather than individual value maximization (c.f., Rokkan, Heide, and Wathne 2003). In relationships focused on long- term shared benefits, both parties recognize that individual transactions are part of a larger affiliation (Macneil 1981). A strong norm of solidarity discourages miscreant behavior by defining it as �illegitimate in the context at hand,� as these behaviors undermine joint value maximization (Rokkan, Heide, and Wathne 2003, 212). Paralleling extant research (e.g., Brown, Dev, and Lee 2000; Rokkan, Heide,  and  Wathne 2003), we expect solidarity to influence the impact    of relationship factors (e.g., TSIs, asymmetric dependence, contractual agreements) on attributions of salesperson guile. Thus, the quality of the working relationship between the buyer  and   salesperson   should   influence   the   govern- ance factors.  When buyers characterize their relationship as possessing solidarity, they tend to view salesperson behaviors as aimed   at benefiting the collective relational output. By shifting the focus from �me� to �we,� the buyer feels  less  concerned  about salesperson engaging in guileful, self-interested action. As discussed by Rokkan, Heide, and Wathne  (2003,  213), �the presence of a solidarity norm means that normative constraints will exist on a party�s tendency to exploit anoth- er�s specific investments for individual gain.� Similarly, soli- darity provides some assurance that dependence asymmetry will not be �abused� by the salesperson (Heide  and  John  1992, 35). Buyers, therefore, are less likely to attribute equivocal behaviors to self-interest seeking  intent,  despite  the presence of TSIs or asymmetric dependence, because solidarity creates an unlikely context for engaging in action that does not  benefit  the  relationship  (Brown,  Dev,  and  Lee 2000; Rokkan, Heide, and Wathne 2003). By contrast, when relationship solidarity is low, the buyer holds a predis- position to view salesperson behaviors as win-lose, thus exacerbating the attribution of questionable actions as inten- tionally devious in the presence of TSIs or asymmetric dependence. As such, we posit that relationship solidarity influences the extent to which the buyer attributes salesper- son behaviors as guileful as follows:
H4a: Relationship solidarity will weaken the positive relationship between transaction specific investments and the attribution of salesperson guile.H4b: Relationship solidarity will weaken the positive relationship between asymmetric interdependence and the attribution of salesperson guile.  We posited above that contractual agreements will lower the buyer�s expectation of salesperson opportunistic behavior by clearly specifying salesperson�s responsibilities, as well as the consequences for breaching agreements. By augmenting the formal agreement (Poppo and Zenger 2002), relationship solidarity is expected to strengthen the negative relationship between contractual arrangements and attributions of sales- person guile. While contracts serve as blueprints that unify activities between exchange parties working together to achieve joint goals (Mesquita and Brush 2008; Ryall and Sampson 2009), solidarity can help to fill gaps in contracts when unforeseen  circumstances  arise.  Relational  norms, such as solidarity, often serve as �a necessary complement to the adaptive limits of contracts by fostering continuance and bilateralism when change and conflict arise� (Poppo and Zenger 2002, 713). Solidarity should alleviate the buyer�s concerns about the salesperson exploiting holes in the con- tract or taking advantage of unexpected changes, and thus further lowering the buyer�s expectations of being exploited. Due to perceptual assimilation, the buyer is less likely to interpret equivocal behaviors as guileful when a contract is augmented by solidarity. Specifically, we posit:H4c: Relationship solidarity will strengthen the negative relationship between contractual arrangements and the attribution of salesperson guile.Antecedents of perceived salesperson opportunismIn interfirm interactions, buyers regularly reflect on actions taken by their salesperson (Narayandas and Rangan 2004). Incomplete data complicate these efforts to make inferences based on empirical grounds and lead to judgments fraught with uncertainty. In the absence of complete information, induction is unavoidable (Voorspoels et  al. 2015). Induction is a process of moving from the specific proposition to a generalization (Nisbett et al. 1983). Through induction, indi- viduals make inferences from observed conditions to unob- served factors (Tsang and Williams 2012). When individuals make inductive inferences, they arrive  at  conclusions  that  are not certain given available evidence (Kemp and Tenenbaum 2009). Over the course of many observations, individuals draw conclusions about the sentiments of others with whom  they  interact  (Osherson  et  al.  1991).  Since   the overall evaluation stems from a series of individual  events, it is germane to consider how individual events affect assessments.  The influence of critical incidents has received substantial attention (e.g., Gremler 2004), but less is known about more mundane events. Consider the specific behavior exhibited by   a salesperson that leads to an inductive generalization about the salesperson�s motivations. This process of moving from
the buyer�s attributions of salesperson guile for a specific event to the buyer�s broader perception of salesperson opportunism is the central focus of the ex post opportunism attribution process. To the extent that a buyer views a ques- tionable salesperson behavior as innocuous, s/he is less likely to view the salesperson as opportunistic in general. By con- trast, when the buyer views the behavior to be a result of salesperson guile, then s/he is generally more likely to view the salesperson as opportunistic. Hence, we hypothesize:H5: Buyer attribution of salesperson guile is related positively to perceived salesperson opportunism.Outcomes of perceived salesperson opportunismExtant research shows that the degree of anger and frustra- tion expressed in reaction to a harmful behavior is in part dependent on how much information  is  available  to  the  actor regarding the cause of the behavior (Kelley 1971). Similarly, we argue that the buyer�s relational response is contingent on how they  explain  and  attribute  the  behavior of their salesperson. While attribution theory, and more spe- cifically correspondence bias, suggests that it may be natural for actors to assume that adverse outcomes  that  are  the  result of others� actions are due to factors under the control    of these actors (Gilbert and Malone 1995), we seek to under- stand the extent to which perceived opportunism may be loaded with reactionary consequences.  Kelley (1973, 127) states that attributions form �the basis for decisions about how to act in order to bring about the continuance or discontinuance of those effects.� When  a buyer attributes questionable salesperson behavior to causes within the salesperson�s control, it is expected that the buyer will pull back relational commitments. Empirical research supports this notion that opportunism has deleterious effects on relationship quality (Crosno and Dahlstrom 2008), with such adverse relational responses plausibly including a decreased willingness of the buyer to invest further resources into the continuation of the relationship. The buyer is also likely to withdraw cooperation and be less committed to maintaining relational continuity when a channel partner is perceived to be opportunistic (Samaha, Palmatier, and Dant 2011). Together, a negative relationship between buyer per- ceptions of salesperson opportunism and the buyer�s rela- tional commitments (i.e., willingness to invest,  expectations  of continuity) are expected.  In addition to these relational responses, buyers may also take retributive action to restore balance when perceptions of salesperson opportunism are high. In other words, when buyers determine that salespeople are acting opportunistic- ally, they are inclined to respond with similar self-interest seeking behavior. Retributive opportunism may be employed as a means to penalize the channel partner or mitigate the occurrence of such behaviors in the future (Gundlach, Achrol, and Mentzer 1995). As discussed by Brown, Krishen, and Dev (2014), opportunism can be a useful tool for managing partner opportunism, as this tit-for-tat strategy signals to the partner that their behavior is not
inconsequential. Retributive opportunism conveys a message to the salesperson that their self-interest may be jeopardized   if the buyer continues to perceive salesperson opportunism (Das and Rahman 2001). Therefore, we expect:H6: Buyer perceptions of salesperson opportunism are related negatively to willingness to invest in the relationship.H7: Buyer perceptions of salesperson opportunism are related	negatively	to	expectations	of relationship continuity.H8: Buyer perceptions of salesperson opportunism are related positively to retributive opportunism.MethodologyStudy 1The empirical context for this study is buyer-supplier rela- tionships in the U.S. healthcare industry. Medical buyers reported on their facility�s relationship with a primary sup-  plier. Prior to data collection, one buyer and one supplier provided assistance in the development of equivocal oppor- tunistic behaviors. First, the supplier was provided with a definition of questionable behavior�an act that one cannot easily determine if it is  deceitful,  self-interested  action  on the part of the supplier, or if it is an honest mistake outside  the control of the supplier�and then asked to create exam-  ples of such salesperson behaviors. Based on the feedback, three scenarios were developed. Next, these scenarios were presented to a buying team at a Mid-Atlantic University hospital. The team was asked to rank the  scenarios  along three dimensions: (a) most representative of an ambiguous behavior, (b) most realistic/plausible, and (c) most applicable to a broad-base of buyers in the healthcare industry. Based    on the team�s feedback, the following equivocal salesperson scenario was deemed the most realistic and most broadly applicable to buyers in the healthcare industry:Your vendor sales representative often sells you product kits that bundle products together for specific procedures (e.g., biopsy packs, phlebotomy services). In the last shipment you received, you noticed that the branded products were replaced with comparable, unbranded products. Your vendor did not give you an  advanced  notice of this substitution and no discount was passed  along to your facility.  The buying team also provided input concerning the applicability of the survey items to the medical context, resulting in minor modifications of the survey.  An  online data collection service (MarketTools) was next used to sur- vey buyers in the healthcare industry. Such panel data col- lection approaches are common in  the  sales  domain  (Johnson 2016), plausibly because panel data provides timely access to prescreened, specialized respondents in a cost effi- cient manner and has been found to be as reliable as data collected through more traditional means (Hartmann and Rutherford 2015). To recruit participants, MarketTools emailed an invitation to take part in an academic study to
5,909 healthcare employees. Respondents were guaranteed confidentiality and were compensated by MarketTools for their participation. A total of 640 respondents reported hav- ing experience in the purchasing process, of which 399 were filtered out as they had not participated in the final purchas- ing decision for medical-related products or services within  the past two years. Of the remaining 241 respondents, 28 respondents were deleted from the analysis due to  incom- plete (i.e., less than ninety percent completion) or invalid questionnaires (i.e., invariant responses  across  multiple  pages of the survey), resulting in a final sample size of 213 medical buyers. These buyers were asked to reflect on their relationship with the salesperson  from  their  largest  vendor of medical supplies. With this specific salesperson in mind, buyers were asked to explain why the above substitution occurred and then to complete a questionnaire.MeasurementEstablished, multi-items scales measured the variables in the model (see Appendix A). TSI was measured with a three- item, Likert scale adapted from Anderson (1988). To meas- ure asymmetric interdependence, the three-item metrics of buyer dependence and vendor dependence developed by Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp (1995) were  modified  for  this study. The degree of asymmetric interdependence was calculated as the difference between the dependence of the buyer and the supplier. A single-item captured the extent to which a contract regulated interactions between  the  buyer  and salesperson (i.e., contractual arrangements; Young and Wilkinson 1998). The three-item  measure  of  relational norms developed by Rokkan, Heide, and Wathne (2003) assessed relationship solidarity.  The measure of the buyer�s attribution of guile was  assessed via four sematic differential items attributing intent  to the salesperson. These items were  developed  for  this  study based on discussions by Williamson (1985, 2003) regarding the inference problems endemic to assessing moti- vations underlying questionable behavior. Perceived salesper- son opportunism was measured with  a  six-item  scale  adapted from Heide, Wathne, and Rokkan (2007). Three outcome variables were examined in the model. First, the buyer�s willingness to invest further in the relationship was measured with a three-item, Likert format  scale  adapted  from Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp (1995). Second, a three-item, Likert scale adapted from Lusch and Brown  (1996) measured the buyer�s expectations of relationship continuity. Finally, the buyer�s intent to engage in retributive opportunism was based on the six-item retributive  inten-  tions scale offered by Skarlicki, Ellard, and Kellin (1998).Consistent  with  prior  research  (e.g.,  Alavi  et  al.  2018;Claro and Ramos 2018), we attempted to control for con- textual factors. Whereas buyers who experience component substitutions more frequently may be  inclined  to  attribute  the salesperson�s behavior to guile  (Williamson  1985),  buyers reported on the frequency with which buyers experi- enced component substitutions and the number of large substitutions. Buyers also reported on the length of time as       a buyer  and the length of time  working with the  salesperson.
We also examined whether the size of the institution influ- enced the model (via buyer reports of number of beds and employees). We further controlled for whether purchases  were part of a collective purchasing  arrangement  and  whether purchases were primarily product or services.Measurement validation proceduresScale assessment followed the procedures outlined by Anderson and Gerbing (1988). Exploratory factor analysis warranted elimination of one item from the attributions of guile and relationship solidarity scales and two items from  the TSI and retributive opportunism metrics. We employed EQS for confirmatory factor analysis and the structural equation models. Hair et al. (2017) indicates that structural component-based analyses offer advantages over partial least squares in estimating measurement models. This approach provides the opportunity to  assess  common  method  bias  and enables comparisons with prior aligned research. The initial confirmatory model evinced a modest fit (v2(369) 666.085, p < 0.01; RMR	0.056, SRMR	0.056, RMSEA0.077, BBNFI	0.835, BBNNFI	0.903,  CFI	0.918,Bollen�s IFI 0.919), limited in part by low factor loadings. Based on low factor loadings, we deleted two items from the perceived salesperson opportunism scale and three items from the retributive opportunism scale. Our resulting model offered  a  better  fit  with  the   data  (v2(288)      471.607,  p < 0.01;  RMR     0.055,  SRMR     0.055,  RMSEA 0.068,BBNFI     0.854, BBNNFI     0.922, CFI     0.936, Bollen�s IFI0.937).  All items loaded significantly (p < .01) on their respect- ive constructs, supporting convergent validity. The internal consistency and reliability measures all exceed 0.70, and the average variance of each construct exceeds 0.50. We subse- quently estimated a series of models that compared the fit of the confirmatory model with a model that set the covari- ance of two constructs at unity. In each case, the Chi-square statistic for the constrained model supports the discriminant validity of the metrics. Table 2 presents the correlations among the variables along with descriptive statistics for each construct.Common method variance and non-response biasTo account for common method variance, we used Harmon�s one-factor test to diagnose whether the method represented an alternative explanation for our results (Dahlquist and Griffith 2014; Kuester and Rauch 2016; Podsakoff et al. 2003). This procedure resulted in nine fac- tors explaining 83.7% of the total variance, with the first fac- tor accounting for 26.9% of the total variance. Second, drawing on Lindell and Whitney (2001), we included a marker variable (buying role) in our model (Miao, Evans, and Li 2017; Noordhoff et al. 2011). The marker variable was not significantly related to any of the outcome variables: perceived  salesperson  opportunism  (c  ?  -.10,  p  >  .10), willingness  to  invest  (c  ?  -.03,  p  >  .10),  expectations  of continuity (c ? .04, p > .10), and retributive opportunism (c ? .05, p > .10). We also compared the measurement

model with a rival model that allowed all variables to load freely onto a method factor (Heide, Wathne, and Rokkan 2007). The inclusion of the method factor was not signifi- cant (v2(25) 30.817, p > 0.05) and yielded only a .03% increase in variance explained. These results suggest that common method variance does not significantly influence the results. Non-response bias was examined by comparing early and late respondents across the variables in the study (Armstrong and Overton 1977); results did not reveal any significant differences.FindingsWe tested the hypotheses via structural equation modeling. The model suggests some reasonable fit to the data (v2(143) 594.618, p < .01; RMR	.176, SRMR	0.156, RMSEA0.157, BBNFI	0.938, BBNNFI	0.929, CFI	0.952,Bollen�s IFI 0.952). The data suggest the control variables influence the model. The number of substitutions (b.253; p <.05) and years of working with the supplier (b  .207; p <.05) reduce the attribution of guile, whereas years of buying experience (b .221; p <.05) and a collective purchasing agreement (b  .169;  p  <.05)  increase  the  reported  level  of  guile.  Large  substitutions  (b      .170;       p >.05), number of beds (b .041; p >.05), number of employees  (b  .139;  p  >.05), and  products (versus  ser-  vice) purchasing (b .046; p >.05) do not influence attri-  butions of guile.  Consistent with H1, attributions of salesperson guile emerge from TSIs (b  .274; p <.05).  The buyer�s attribu-  tions of salesperson guile is associated negatively with asym- metric  interdependence  (b   .241;  p  <.05),  which  is  counter to the hypothesized direction of H2.  Contractual arrangements (b .265; p <.05) lower the attributions of salesperson guile, which supports H3. The interaction of solidarity with other governance factors is central to the fourth hypothesis. Consistent with H4a (b  .289; p <.05), the interaction of TSIs with solidarity leads   to lower attributions. Figure 2a charts the influence of this interaction on guile utilizing the method advanced by Schoonhoven (1981). As the figure suggests, increases in relationship solidarity and TSIs lower perceptions of salesperson guile. H4c is also supported given the statistic- ally significant interaction of relationship solidarity with contractual  arrangements  (b     .262;  p  <.05).  Figure  2b also uses Schoonhoven�s (1981) method to illustrate
reductions in guile attributions in relationships managed via contractual arrangements and solidarity. The interaction of relationship solidarity with asymmetric interdependence is insignificant (b ? .045; p >.05), leading to H4b being rejected. Moving downstream, the model supports H5, as attributions of salesperson guile yield higher perceptions of salesperson opportunism (c .340, p < .05). Finally, per- ceived salesperson opportunism lowers expectations of rela- tionship  continuity  (c  ?  -.456,  p  <  .05)  and  increases retributive opportunism (c ? .796, p < .05); yet is unrelated to  willingness  to  invest  in  the  relationship  (c ? -.170,  p  >.05). These results lend support to H7 and H8, but do not support H6. See Table 3 for a summary of the results.  The proposed empirical model served as the basis for comparison with a model that employed only the third indi- cator of attribution of salesperson guile and with another model that used the  first indicator of relationship solidarity.  In both comparisons, neither the magnitude nor direction of the hypothesized paths changed significantly. We  retained  the multi-item measures because they capture more infor- mation than can be provided by a single measure (Bergkvist and Rossiter 2007). We also employed response surface ana- lysis to evaluate robustness of difference scores  used  to  assess asymmetric interdependence. The results generally support the difference score metric. The lowest attributions    of salesperson guile occur when the supplier is highly dependent and buyer is not. The highest attributions of salesperson guile occur when both are dependent on the relationship, yet the buyer�s dependence outpaces the suppli- er�s dependence.Study 2The results of Study 1 suggest that that the assessment  of guile leads to generalizations about  a  seller�s  opportunism. In Study 2, we sought to augment these results in a balanced replication (Sawyer and Peter 1983) drawn from buyers rep- resenting a broader sampling frame. Procurement manager members of a supply chain association served as our sample. The association initially e-mailed 9,386 of its members to gauge receptiveness to receiving a survey. A total of 549 responses were received, with 508 members responding favorably. Respondents were incentivized to  participate  in  the survey with (a) access to a research report summarizing the findings of the study, (b) an invitation to attend a

webinar in which the researchers discuss the results of the study, and (c) eligibility to win one of 30 $25 gift cards to a leading online retailer. Upon entering the site where the  survey was hosted, respondents assumed the role of a buyer for a hospital and read the same scenario provided to the medical buyers. We received 294 survey responses but removed nine responses from the data due incomplete information (i.e., less than ninety percent completed),  resulting in a sample of 285 buyers and a 56.1% response   rate among informants who agreed to participate  in  the  study. Comparison of  early  versus  late  respondent  responses on several background variables (e.g., company size) were not statistically significant and suggest that non- response bias is not problematic.  The survey measures and analyses replicated the metrics and procedures of the first study. We further sought to examine whether contextual factors influence the relation- ships of (a) attributions of salesperson guile on perceived
salesperson opportunism and (b) perceived salesperson opportunism on willingness to invest, expectations of con- tinuity, and retributive opportunism. We incorporated buyer experience, years in position, company size, number of employees, and purchase size in the analysis. Buyer experi- ence and years in position may  constrain  perceptions  of seller miscreant behavior and lead to a  desire  to  maintain and invest in the relationship (Stanko,  Bonner,  and  Calantone 2007). Larger organizations and larger contracts should similarly lead to less opportunism and enhanced working relationships (Bowman 2012).  We employed EQS to estimate the confirmatory factor structure and the structural equation models. The first con- firmatory model offered a relatively modest fit (v2(179) 532.447, p < 0.01; RMR	0.161, SRMR	0.064, RMSEA0.084, BBNFI	0.851, BBNNFI	0.877,  CFI	0.895,Bollen�s IFI 0.896). As in the initial study, low factor load- ings   warranted  deletion  of  two  items  from   the  perceived

The resulting model yielded a better fit to the data (v2(94) 217.189, p < 0.01; RMR 0.163, SRMR 0.066, RMSEA 0.069, BBNFI0.900, BBNNFI 0.923, CFI 0.940, Bollen�s IFI 0.941).  Appendix B provides the factor loadings for each metric. All items loaded significantly (p < .01) on their respective constructs, supporting convergent validity. The internal con- sistency (.43) and reliability (.69) of attributions of salesper- son guile are modest, whereas the reliability of all other measures exceeds 0.70 and the average variance of each con- struct exceeds 0.50. We estimated a series of models that compared the confirmatory model with rivals that set the covariance of two constructs at unity. Chi-square difference tests between the models support the discriminant validity of the metrics. Table 4 presents the correlations among the variables and descriptive statistics for each construct.Common method variance and non-response biasWe employed Harmon�s one-factor test to diagnose whether the method represented an alternative explanation for our results. This procedure resulted in six factors explaining
73.7% of the total variance, with the first factor accounting for 27.4% of the total. We subsequently included a marker variable (buying role) in our model. This marker was not related significantly to any outcome variable: perceived sales- person opportunism (�  .80, p > .10), willingness to invest (c .11, p > .10), expectations of continuity (c .01, p >.10),   and   retributive opportunism  (c	.04, p > .10). Comparison of the measurement model with a rival model, that allowed all variables to load freely onto a method factor, indicated the method factor was not significant (v2(25) 11.040, p > 0.05) and yielded only a .05% increase in variance explained. These results suggest common method variance does not influence the results significantly. Finally, comparison of data from early and  late  respondents did not reveal any significant differences, suggesting that non- response bias was not appreciable.FindingsThe initial structural equation model offered a modest rep- resentation of the data (v2 (21)	541.929, p < 0.01; RMR.077, SRMR	0.182, RMSEA	0.307, BBNFI	0.945,BBNNFI	0.862, CFI	0.947, Bollen�s IFI	0.947) due,in part, to the inclusion of statistically insignificant effects of the control variables. We deleted insignificant effects of years in position on all dependent variables, but retained the influence of buyer experience on perceived salesperson opportunism  (b     .172;  p  < .05), willingness  to invest  (c     .383; p < .05), expectations of continuity (c     .171;  p < .05), and retributive opportunism (c  .157; p < .05).  We also retained company size as an antecedent to willing- ness to invest (c ? -.355; p < .05), as well as the influences of  number  of  employees  (c ? -.120; p  < .05)  and  purchase

This revised model offers a marginally better fit (v2(34) 553.793, p < 0.01;  RMR      .075,  SRMR      0.186,  RMSEA 0.241,BBNFI     0.944, BBNNFI     0.915, CFI     0.947, Bollen�s IFI   0.948) and is more parsimonious. Consistent with H5, attributions of salesperson guile increase perceived salesperson opportunism (b ? .457, p < .05).

These results further support H5�H8. See Table 5 for a sum- mary of the results.DiscussionThe goal of this research is to gain a better understanding      of buyer evaluations of questionable salesperson behaviors. The research examines how characteristics of the interfirm relationship influence buyer evaluations of a  particular  act and subsequently looks at the influences of the questionable act on the interfirm relationship. In contrast to much of the research in this area, this study focuses on equivocal behav- iors�i.e., behaviors that cannot be easily categorized as sim- ple self-interest seeking or as self-interest seeking with guile. The observation of blatant, miscreant acts tends to serve as grounds for dissolution of an agreement. By contrast, equivocal behavior may or  may not lead  to  attributions  that a trading partner has been devious.  Attribution theory provides important insights into when equivocal behavior will be interpreted as guileful, as well as potential responses to guileful attributions (Gilbert and  Malone 1995; Kelley 1971). Observers generate expectations about how people typically act in certain situations and then they compare the actor�s behavior with these expectations. Observers, however, compare their expectations with their perceptions of the actor�s behavior rather than the actor�s actual behavior (Gilbert and Malone 1995). Awareness of situational factors often leads to perceptual assimilation of
the equivocal behavior (Trope 1986; Trope,  Cohen,  and  Maoz 1988). Correspondingly, in a buyer-seller relationship,  a buyer�s keen awareness of relationship factors may result    in heightened (or reduced) expectations of opportunism, which in turn influences their attribution of salesperson guile via perceptual assimilation of the equivocal behavior (i.e., inflated categorization effect; Trope 1986; Trope, Cohen, and Maoz 1988). With the exception of asymmetric interdepend- ence, the results of our study support this contention.Investments in idiosyncratic assets, which makes one vul-nerable to opportunistic exploitation, increase attributions of guile; whereas asymmetric interdependence and contractual arrangements lower attributions of guile. Such relationships with attributions of salesperson guile (e.g., TSIs, contractual arrangements), however, are moderated by relationship soli- darity. The results from this study also provide insight con- cerning the consequences of equivocal salesperson behavior being interpreted as guileful  (whether  interpreted  correctly or not). Attributions of salesperson guile raises the  likeli- hood of perceiving the salesperson as  opportunistic,  and  these perceptions of salesperson opportunism, in turn, limit relational continuity and fuel retributive opportunism. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed in the next two sections.Theoretical implicationsThe results of this study shine a light on the struggle to understand motives underlying the actions taken by rela-  tional partners. While TCE encourages buyers  to  focus  on the development of governance structures that  limit  expos- ure to opportunism a priori (Rindfleisch and  Heide  1997), this study suggests that the tenets of attribution theory pro- vide insight into the degree to which buyers view equivocal behavior as miscreant ex post. Such findings are important contributions to influential work regarding the unobservable nature of guile (e.g., Seggie, Griffith, and Jap 2013) and
buyer  inferences  of   ulterior   salesperson   motives   (Alavi et al. 2018).  Findings show the governance structures that serve as antecedents in our model also serve as  situational  factors  that affect interpretations of salesperson behavior. As assets become more idiosyncratic to a relationship, they serve as situational constraints that lead to greater  attributions  of  guile. By contrast, asymmetric interdependence, relationship solidarity, and contractual arrangements lower the likelihood of attributing equivocal behavior to guile. Within this set of findings, the negative relationship between asymmetric inter- dependence and attributions of salesperson guile was unex-  pected and merits reconsideration (Heide and John 1988).1  While the hypothesized relationship between interdepend- ency and attributions of guile was well-ground in theory, the findings suggest that the asymmetric interdependence oper- ates in contrast to the dependence garnered from TSIs.  Specific assets only consider the buyer, yet asymmetry looks at both the buyer and salesperson. Asymmetrical interdepend- ence calls attention to the buyer�s reliance on the salesperson and may trigger the buyer to reflect on the performance disadvantages stemming from this dependence. Specific investments, however, do not generate the same targeted association with dependence on the supplier. In reconsider- ation of the hypothesized relationship, signs of a negative relationship are present in extant  literature.  Gundlach, Achrol, and Mentzer (1995) report that disproportionate lev- els of commitment do not necessarily lead to miscreant behavior; while Gassenheimer, Davis, and Dahlstrom (1998) show firms that are asymmetrically dependent on a trading partner may remain in a relationship because it continues to provide appreciable levels of satisfaction and performance. Furthermore, Trope, Cohen, and Maoz (1988) indicate heightened dependency in  a  long-term  relationship  serves  as a situational constraint that results in assimilation of questionable or equivocal behavior. Additional research  is thus  called  for  that  considers  how  attribution  processes vary   between   dyadic   and    monadic    operationalizations of dependency.  The results gleaned from both studies suggest that buyers who attribute questionable behavior to salespeople  are inclined to view salespeople as opportunistic. This inductive process may be framed by decision  making  criteria  employed to simplify judgments (Katsikopoulos 2011). Decision making research suggests that causal induction consists of a heuristic stage for distinguishing relevant causal factors from irrelevant factors and an analytic stage for dis- criminating between genuine and spurious causes  (Hattori  and Oaksford 2007). The buyer�s assessment of the likeli- hood that the salesperson acted in a guileful, self-interested manner was intended to examine the buyer�s use of the salesperson�s activity as a heuristic. This heuristic should inform the buyer�s judgment, but the buyer�s assessment is  also framed by efforts  to  make  causal  inferences  (Hattori  et al. 2017). Induction therefore requires consideration of factors that lead to an initial assessment of behavior  along with investigation into conditions that lead decision makers   to assert causes of trading partner behavior. Research is
warranted that considers whether heuristic or analytical judgments serve as the basis for attributions of behavior.  Both studies also provide insight into conditions  that lead to retributive opportunism. Specifically, the buyer�s perception of salesperson opportunism induces reciprocal guileful, self- interest seeking by the buyer. Long-term relationships are jeopardized as buyers retaliate in reaction to salesperson mis- creant behavior (Das and Rahman 2001), however such retri- bution may also serve as a governance mechanism. Our findings build upon the work of Gundlach, Achrol, and Mentzer (1995), which recognizes that opportunism can arise in the negotiation and administration of exchange relation- ships, by focusing  specifically on the latter. Further research  is needed that considers how opportunism that originates in  the negotiation process subsequently fuels perceptions of opportunism and retributive opportunism over the  course  of  a contract. Collectively, this study extends lines of research  on salesperson opportunism and deception, salesperson influ- ence tactics, and buyer suspicions of salesperson ulterior motives by focusing on equivocal salesperson actions, simul- taneously assessing multiple relational conditions which shape buyer perceptions, and empirically assessing buyer responses that occur within the context of an ongoing relationship (e.g., retributive opportunism) (see Table 1).Managerial implicationsBeyond the theoretical contributions, this research derives sales strategy insights by investigating a phenomenon of interest from the buyer�s perspective (see Paesbrugghe et al. 2018). As such, this study offers numerous implications to sales organizations and managers. First, the study under- scores the conditions when buyers are more likely to view some equivocal salesperson behaviors as miscreant. Buyers that attribute equivocal behavior to ill-intent  are  then  inclined to generalize that the salesperson  is  opportunistic  and respond accordingly. The observation that a salesperson  is opportunistic then provides justification to retaliate opportunistically and reduce commitment to the relation-  ship. Thus, questionable behaviors, which are pervasive throughout buyer-seller exchanges, hold important manager- ial implications to the extent that they can lead to a decline    in the quality of an exchange relationship.Fortunately, the relationship factors which have a desir-able influence on the buyer�s attribution of salesperson guile (e.g., contractual arrangements) or a mitigating influence on less desirable influences (e.g., relationship solidarity) are observable and can be strategically accentuated by the sales organization. For example, sales managers can put oper- ational guidelines in place which stipulate the necessity of well-documented agreements in order  to  safeguard  their  sales teams from disadvantageous attributions. Likewise, to the extent that relationship solidarity is developed by a cus- tomer-oriented approach to selling, managers should culti-  vate a culture of promoting long-term strategic partnerships and a direct sales approach in order to encourage such an orientation (Gulati and Sytch 2007).
  Beyond the implications stemming from management, salespeople should also take into consideration how facets of the relationship may influence buyer  evaluations.  Buyers  that have invested heavily in the unique procedures or prod- ucts of a selling firm  are more likely to view equivocal acts  as nefarious. These TSIs are generally made to enhance the buyer�s operations (Ghosh and John 1999), but they simultan- eously increase the perceived risk faced by the buyer. Salespeople should look to quell these attributions by reduc- ing risk perceptions, possibly by developing long-term  security through negotiated contracts that may obviate rela- tionships from encountering opportunism (Macneil 1981).Limitations and future researchThe results of this study should be tempered by the follow-  ing limitations. Relationships operate over time and are manifest in multiple ways, yet our study does not capture changes occurring over time via data from multiple vantage points. Our measure of the level of solidarity offers a modest assessment of the construct, yet research would benefit from   a more detailed assessment of this important facet of inter- firm interactions. As Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987) illus- trate, long-term commitment to a relationship emerges with the passing of time. Opportunism may appear in contractual negotiation, as well as in the implementation of the contract; prevailing opportunism is likely to influence perceptions of guile.2 Nevertheless, we sought to examine influences of governance factors on these perceptions. We  investigate  these factors direct and contingent influence on the attribu- tion of salesperson guile, as well as how  individual  acts  affect the ascription of opportunism to a trading partner. Charting the development of relationships from inception would provide an opportunity to investigate how opportun- ism develops in the negotiation of contracts. A longitudinal approach would enable the research to consider how nego- tiations influence opportunism in the implementation of the contract. In addition, charting the progression of these agreements would provide greater insight regarding how questionable behaviors influence relationship vitality.The  results  also  underscore  the  merits  of  examining thepersonal characteristics of buyers. The buyer�s level of indi- vidualism may frame the degree to which one attributes intentionality to the trading partner rather than context (Hofstede 1991). Similarly, the buyer�s toleration for uncer- tainty avoidance may affect the tendency to attribute ques- tionable acts to the miscreant action of a salesperson (Laufer and Coombs 2006). Additionally, the survey data collected sought to capture buyer perceptions of the quality of inter- firm relationships (i.e., attitudinal data), yet the validity of such data could be enhanced by augmenting them with objective performance measures. For example, the willing- ness to invest in a relationship could be replaced by charting actual investments in a trading partner, and expectations of continuity could be replaced with a longitudinal measure of relationship longevity. Broader sources of data  provide greater confidence in the measures and the inferences made concerning  relationships  among  constructs  (Podsakoff  et al.
2003); thus they may help bring insight to the unsupported relationships. Specific to the hypothesis between perceived salesperson opportunism and the buyer�s  willingness  to invest, objective data may be able to show a buyer turning a blind eye to perceived opportunism when the actual invest- ments garner returns.  While we examine how buyers perceive and categorize their salesperson�s equivocal behavior, errors in other steps    of the attribution process could also affect this  interpret- ation. For example, buyers may fail to recognize situational constraints affecting a salesperson�s behavior (i.e., informa- tion asymmetry). Furthermore, when they are aware of situ- ational constraints, buyers may have unrealistic expectations about how a salesperson should behave under those con- straints (Gilbert and Malone 1995).  Therefore,  future  research should consider other  potential  errors  in  the  buyer�s attributions process. Lastly, future research should  also address the methodological limitations, such as the response rate and measurement, of this research.ConclusionThis study aimed to assess relationship factors which frame buyer perceptions of salesperson behavior and to  examine how buyers respond based on their perceptions. The results suggest that TSIs increase attributions of salesperson guile, while asymmetric interdependence and contractual arrange- ments lower this attribution. Relationship solidarity moder- ated most of these relationships between  relational  factors and buyer attributions of salesperson guile. Attributions of salesperson guile are associated with perceived salesperson opportunism, which in turn yields retributive  opportunism  and reduces expectations of relationship continuity. These findings provide insights for sales force management theory and practice, along with the omnipresent reality of attribu- tions associated with equivocal salesperson behaviors.Notes1. One possible explanation for this unexpected finding is that buyers would not put themselves in a precarious situation unless the supplier would not/could not exploit their dependence. Buyers, for example, may have offsetting investments to balance their dependence on their suppliers (Heide and John 1988), therein lowering their expectations   of opportunism and their attributions of guile.2.
